    Opt-in binding approach: Only expose interfaces and classes that are needed by users.

    FlushableExecutorService is an internal interface used by the Datadog SDK but not needed
    in the public API. It causes binding issues with generic/non-generic IList conversions
    in the shutdownNow() method inherited from ExecutorService.

    Since this is an internal interface not needed by SDK users, we remove it entirely.
