Additions allow you to add arbitrary C# code to the generated binding.

Additions are placed in the Additions/ folder and will be merged with the generated
binding source code. New classes, methods, properties, and events can be added here.

This is useful for:
- Adding helper methods or extension methods
- Implementing interfaces or partial classes
- Providing additional documentation or comments
- Working around binding limitations

Example:

  namespace Com.Datadoghq.Android {
      public partial class DatadogSdk {
          // Add custom helper method
          public static void InitializeWithDefaults(string clientToken, string environment) {
              // Custom initialization logic
          }
      }
  }
